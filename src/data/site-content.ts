    "I'm a software engineer with a focus on building reliable backend systems and developer tools that make complex infrastructure feel effortless. My work blends backend engineering, cloud systems, and AI-driven workflows—all aimed at improving developer experience and scalability.",
    "In May 2025, I graduated from Arizona State University with a Master's in Computer Science, where I explored distributed systems, cloud computing, and data processing at scale.",
    "Outside of academics, I'm currently at Liberty Mutual Insurance as a contractor supporting claims and policy workflows. I've also worked at Ernst & Young GDS India, where I helped develop an internal document management system to reduce operational overhead for multiple teams. During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to work with Professor Yinong Chen as a TA during the 7up and 9up Robotics Camps, teaching school students Robotics and IoT. I later worked under him as a Graduate Student Assitant for his CSE445 and CSE446 courses.",
    "Lately, I've been experimenting with Rust, Go, and TypeScript- pushing my craft toward building faster, more resilient systems.",
